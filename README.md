# Card game 3 and 2
-This game consists of two players having 5 cards (they cannot have more than 5), on the "game table" is the pack of cards that they cannot see and next to it is a displayed card. The game is that the player who has 3 equal cards of one type and 2 equal cards of another type wins the game.

# How to play:
The rules are very simple, either player can start, when it is a player's turn he has 2 options:

1- Take the displayed card.
2- Take a card from the package.

-Option 1: For the player to be able to take the displayed card he must have in his deck one that is the same, if so, the player who take the card must leave a card from his deck and that card pass to be the card shown and pass the turn, if not, then he cannot take the displayed card and is forced to take one from the package.

-Option 2: When the player takes a card from the package he decides if he wants to keep it or leave it as the card shown, if the player keeps it then he must leave a card from his deck to be the card shown and pass the turn, otherwise the card that took from the package happens to be the card shown and pass the turn.

-This loop is maintained until one of the two players has 3 equal cards of one type and 2 equal cards of another type, if this is so then that player is the winner.
